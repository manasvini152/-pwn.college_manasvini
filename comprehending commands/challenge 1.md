# **COMPREHENDING COMMANDS**
## **<ins>CAT: NOT THE PET, BUT THE COMMAND!</ins>**
We learn about the linux command cat. which is used for reading out files.
### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{0GPdyoAqq43nG26l7DKCgb4d2QG.QXxcTN0wSO2kjNzEzW}

The flag file exists in the home directory, which can be read with cat.
cat concatenates multiple files if multiple arguments are provided. 
hence if the command cat flag is used we obtain the flag.

```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{0GPdyoAqq43nG26l7DKCgb4d2QG.QXxcTN0wSO2kjNzEzW}
```
