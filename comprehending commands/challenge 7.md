# **COMPREHENDING COMMANDS**
## **<ins>TOUCHING FILES</ins>**
Here we learn how to create an empty file by touching it using the touch command.
### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{c3LOQY8C04HmbFwQJJpmiG20897.QXwMDO0wSO2kjNzEzW}

First I created the files using the touch command, that is using touch /tmp/pwn and touch /tmp/college which created two blank files.
Then I invoked the command /challenge/run which gave me the flag.

```
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/college
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c3LOQY8C04HmbFwQJJpmiG20897.QXwMDO0wSO2kjNzEzW}
```
