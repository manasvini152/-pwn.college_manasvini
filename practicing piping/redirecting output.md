We can redirect the output using the > character. 

### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{ILcRA8wx9UntR97CD5OxvCYTezs.QX0YTN0wSO2kjNzEzW}

I used the command echo PWN > COLLEGE which redirected PWN to the file named COLLEGE. Which redirected the output of PWN to the file 
COLLEGE. 

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{ILcRA8wx9UntR97CD5OxvCYTezs.QX0YTN0wSO2kjNzEzW}
```

### WHAT I LEARNED: 
I learnt the use of the character > and how to redirect the output to a file.

### REFERENCES:
None.
