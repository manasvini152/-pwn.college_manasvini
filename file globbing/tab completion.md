# **FILE GLOBBING**
## **<ins>TAB COMPLETION</ins>**
Here we use the tab key to auto complete the command.

### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{o_elKue0dY-CfhHAuTx1-5XtL-v.0FN0EzNxwSO2kjNzEzW}

I typed the command cat /challenge/p and then clicked on the tab space to auto complete the command,
which resulted in the flag.

```
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹
pwn.college{o_elKue0dY-CfhHAuTx1-5XtL-v.0FN0EzNxwSO2kjNzEzW}
```

### WHAT I LEARNED:
I learnt about the auto complete feature. Which is known as tab completion. If we hit the tab shell it will try to figure out
what we are going to type and complete it. 

### REFERENCES:
None.
