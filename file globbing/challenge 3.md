# **FILE GLOBBING**
## **<ins>MATCHING WITH []</ins>**
We learn about thye [] operator. It is used as a subset of potential characters. 

### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{YofTP0hitc-UFRqUoQpvh8f8H9w.QXzIDO0wSO2kjNzEzW}

I first changed the directory to /challenge/files using the cd command.
Then I used the command /challenge/run file_[bash].
Hence I obtained the flag.

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{YofTP0hitc-UFRqUoQpvh8f8H9w.QXzIDO0wSO2kjNzEzW}
```
