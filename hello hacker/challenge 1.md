# **HELLO HACKERS**
## **<ins>INTRO TO COMMANDS</ins>**
We learn to invoke our first command. When we type a command and hit enter. The command gets invoked. 
### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{0_swr4F9m0IpMa8Lz5yKDuDDO2C.QX3YjM1wSO2kjNzEzW} 

We enter the hello command and hit enter, hence we obtain a flag when the command is executed. 
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0_swr4F9m0IpMa8Lz5yKDuDDO2C.QX3YjM1wSO2kjNzEzW}
```
### WHAT I LEARNED: 
I learnt how a basic capture the flag works and what a flag looks like, and how to execute a command through a ssh key. I also learnt how to execute a basic hello command.
### REFERENCES:
