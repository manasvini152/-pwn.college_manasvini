# **HELLO HACKERS**
## **<ins>COMMAND HISTORY</ins>**
We learn to access the terminal history. Since we type a lot of commands being able to access the history will make it easier.
### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{cvv7oIls_V15_D61Nlpcd3-J-Y-.0lNzEzNxwSO2kjNzEzW}

After it is connected we scroll up using the up arrow key until the old flag is displayed on the screen, the answer to this challenge is the old flag itself.
Hence the command history makes it easier and we need not type the old commands again. 
```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{cvv7oIls_V15_D61Nlpcd3-J-Y-.0lNzEzNxwSO2kjNzEzW}
bash: the: command not found
```
### WHAT I LEARNED:
I learnt how to access command history with the help of up and down arrow keys.
### REFERENCES:
None.
