# **CHAINING COMMANDS**
## **<ins>CHAINING WITH SEMICOLONS</ins>**
The use of a semicolon is to execute two commands in the same line one by one.

### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{w7teT6wS4vkvPb5pm9mxrlVI0Jv.QX1UDO0wSO2kjNzEzW}

The challenge requires us to link the commands /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college and execute them at once.
We do this by using a semicolon.

```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$  /challenge/pwn;/challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{w7teT6wS4vkvPb5pm9mxrlVI0Jv.QX1UDO0wSO2kjNzEzW}
```
