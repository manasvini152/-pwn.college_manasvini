# **PERCEIVING PERMISSIONS**
## **<ins>PERMISSION TWEAKING PRACTICE</ins>**
We use the commands of u,g,o and r,w,x to find the flag.

### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{om3XCdvhEC0i8QKmuT6ViR-0pVa.QXwEjN0wSO2kjNzEzW}

To give permission we use the + operator and to remove permission we use the - operator.

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod a+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{om3XCdvhEC0i8QKmuT6ViR-0pVa.QXwEjN0wSO2kjNzEzW}
```

### WHAT I LEARNED:
I learnt how to apply the various commands to get the flag.

### REFERENCES:
None.
