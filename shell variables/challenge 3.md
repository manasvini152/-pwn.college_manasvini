To set a value which has spaces to a variable we use quotes.

### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{U_5_YwH6T-IapCfC_UWraT7_-Mf.QXwYTN0wSO2kjNzEzW}

To set values that have spaces, we use quotes. Since spaces have a special significance we cannot use spaces during assignment without 
quotes.
We are asked to set the value COLLEGE YEAH to the variable PWN.
Hence we use the command PWN="COLLEGE YEAH".

```
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{U_5_YwH6T-IapCfC_UWraT7_-Mf.QXwYTN0wSO2kjNzEzW}
```
