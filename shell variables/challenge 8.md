# **SHELL VARIABLES**
## **<ins>READING FILES</ins>**
We can read the input from the file provided to the variable.

### SOLVE: 
***FLAG:*** pwn.college{wlH6evdZQABdm2jHM9t8d1Aa7ra.QXwIDO0wSO2kjNzEzW}

By using the command read PWN < /challenge/read_me we can obtain the flag. Here the variable is PWN and the file is /challenge/read_me.
Here we read the file /challenge/read_me into the variable PWN.

```
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{wlH6evdZQABdm2jHM9t8d1Aa7ra.QXwIDO0wSO2kjNzEzW}
```

### WHAT I LEARNED: 
I learnt how to read files into the variable. 

### REFERENCES:
